# deinprogramm.quickcheck

A Clojure port of the original Haskell QuickCheck.

(We looked at
[ClojureCheck](https://bitbucket.org/kotarak/clojurecheck) and
[`clojure.test.generative`](https://github.com/clojure/test.generative),
but neither seems faithful to the original, particularly concerning the
reproducibility of test runs, and a set of generator combinators that
includes random generation of functions.)

This library, however, is a straighforward port of the Haskell code
from John Hughes's original paper.
